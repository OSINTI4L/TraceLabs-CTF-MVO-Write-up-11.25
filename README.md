## Initial Foothold
When the CTF starts each team member typically chooses one missing person (MP) and attempts to gain an initial foothold. A good starting point includes a Google Dork of the MP by name. This will typically return news stories or postings by family members on social media sites related to the dissapearance. Multiple images of the MP are typically found when performing this type of search. This allows multiple different angles of photos of the MP to help idenftify and confirm things such as MP social media accounts later on, as well as multiple images to be used with facial recognition tools. Other intel points such as usernames, social accounts, etc. can be found and useful during this time as foothold information to be used as data points to pivot from.

## Locating MP Facebook Account
Delilah began gathering data points on "missing person 1" (MP1). A Facebook account was found from searching MP1 name on the Facebook (FB) platform. While enumerating the FB account Delilah noticed shared postings from the MP dated less than 24 hours prior to see the CTF event. Additionally, multiple data points were found of the MP by Delilah when performing people searches and pivoting from links and profiles linked from her pages.

This yielded:
  - 24 Social media accounts & link directories
  - 14 Usernames
  - 4 Emails
  - 10 Accouts linked to found emails
  - 2 Associated addresses
  - 2 Relatives

This is where all hands on deck pivoted focus to MP1. Fresh data points should always be looked into and the focus of the investigation during a TL CTF.

Three images specifically stood out as points of focus when enumerating the account:
