## Initial Foothold
When the CTF starts each member typically chooses one missing person (MP) and attempts to gain an initial foothold. A good place to typically start is a Google Dork of the MP by name. This will typically return news stories or postings by family members on social media sites. Multiple images of the MP are typically found when performing this type of search. This allows multiple different angles of the MP to help idenftify and confirm things such as MP social media accounts later on, as well as multiple images to be used with facial recognition tools. Other intel points such as usernames, social accounts, etc. can all be found and useful during this time as foothold information to be used as data points to pivot from.

## Locating MP Facebook Account
Delilah began gathering data points on "missing person 1" (MP1), this was ultimately the MVO MP. A Facebook account was found from searching MP1 name on the Facebook platform. While enumerating the FB account Delilah noticed shared postings from the MP dated less than 24 hours prior to see the CTF event. This is where all hands on deck pivoted focus to MP1. Fresh data points should always be looked into and the focus of the investigation during a TL CTF.

Additional shared posts on the MP1 profile were found beneath the recent 24 hour post containing images of what appeared to be a photoshoot. Two individuals were seen inside of the "photoshoot" posts, one being the MP and one other individual that was later identified due to being the original poster of the images on Facebook.
